Misery and gin
Here I am drunk again
And gone gone gone
Man I hate these songs
Silver wings
And old lonesome memory
The music plays on
I hate these songs
[Chorus]
Cause I sit in my car
And I bathe in their sorrow
Try to wash away my pain
Just to get through tomorrow
Note by note
Line by line
It cuts to the bone
Man I hate these songs
Crazy four walls
He stopped loving her today
And old lonely street
Ain't it funny how time slips away
And born to loose
Am I losing you
I'm just hanging on
Man I hate these songs
[Chorus]
The music plays on
Man I hate these songs
